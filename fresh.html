    The fish who keeps on swimming.
Is the first to chill upstream.
I want your fish right by me.
That's how it has to be.
The songs I sing they don't mean a thing if you're not there to hear it,
But then soon is the time you'll be by my side.
It's copesetic if you let it so set up and keep the down stream down and up stream up.
Girlfriend boots and all you lookin' fresh again.
Move toward me so I can smell the sweetness of your flesh dam.
Cool down your fine self when I find my way to the wetness of your sweet mouth.
Sweetly in every way that you treat me.
A fish story but you know it's picture perfect.
Our morning glory every time that we wake.
The morning ride is the longest ride take it.
Like this take it like that take a yin and a yang.
It's time to find the kind.
Like my man jack sprat to do down forever it's wetter.
Titillate the flow.
Can't say it any better.
Swimmin' and hummin' with a body and soul.
It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Swimmin' and hummin'.
Can't say it any better.
My Stoney Baby.
My Stoney Baby.
And now I'm in here with my friend ruskie.
In their house but they're not home.
If they find out what's been on.
They'll kick us out and we'll be gone.
No pool and that's not too cool.
The songs I sing they don't mean a thing. If you're not there to hear it,
But then soon is the time you'll be by my side.
It's copesetic if you let it so set it up and keep the down stream down and up stream up.
My stoney, my baby, swings w/the groovin'. Funk the groovin' thang whistlin'.
As I rip my rhymes.
Time and time again struttin'. And in the summertime.
So screw it strip down and be generic.
Strip down and be a passenger, strip down and be a messenger.
In askin' why I'm borI come up blank in the winter.
In askin' why I'm born I come up on when I'm on her.
My summer his summer it could be one to go down to go down.
It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Forever together and then I kiss.
Swimmin' and hummin' with a body and soul.
It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Swimmin' and hummin'.
And then I kiss.
My Stoney Baby.
My Stoney Baby.
My Stoney Baby.
My Stoney Baby.
